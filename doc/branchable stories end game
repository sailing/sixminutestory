branchable stories end game:

phase 1: 
	viewing story, click "continue this story",
	need parent story

	on writing view, show story continuing from.
	on writing view, don't show any prompt
		
	after writing, show new story with end of previous story, fading up

	parent story shows first 200 characters of branched stories, with paginatability via ajax

	on writing / editing story, can mark as "continuable"


	branch view:
		viewing last story in a branch, can scroll up through parent stories. Can also, "jump to beginning", then scroll down from start through all branches that led to current story

	OMG this going to make life so easy

Phase 2:
	On writing view
		- check if person can branch (private, private-to-group?)
		- story can be :branchable?
		- show prompt options: no prompt, random prompt, search for prompt
