</p>
<p>
  It's been 10 years since I built Six Minute Story. A full on decade. I guess that means we're all older now.
</p>
<p>
  In the past ten years, over 750 writers (like you) have written 655,000 words in more than 3500 stories.
</p>
<p>
  Some of you have written oh-so-many stories. Anglea wrote 157.
</p>
<p>
  Some other super-prolific writers of the last decade were:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>ganymeder - 117 stories</li>
    <li>Jayden Nicole - 98</li>
    <li>DoctorMikeReddy - 95</li>
    <li>the-arraignment - 84</li>
    <li>NYgirlLovesCA - 75</li>
    <li>bespectakate - 69</li>
    <li>Gone Awry - 66</li>
    <li>CraigTowsley - 65</li>
    <li>mroshaugh - 61</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  As for me, I've drifted in and out of other projects, sailed up and down the United States' east coast, built some stuff, worked in tech for a long time. 
</p>
<p>
  But Six Minute Story has always been my first love. It's full of story, full of adrenaline, full of revelation. So, for the tenth anniversary, I think a revamp is in order.
</p>
<p>
  Initially that just meant fixing the login form so you can actually log in and write. So I did that. <em><small>(BTW, click any link in this email and you'll be automatically logged in.)</small></em>
</p>
<p>
  But then I thought why not make it even better.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  A few years back some people started writing serialized stories (here's <%= link_to "one from DoctorMikeReddy", story_url(@serialized_story, user_email: @recipient.email, user_token: @recipient.authentication_token) %>, and here's <%= link_to "one from TimSevenhuysen", story_url(@serialized_story_2, user_email: @recipient.email, user_token: @recipient.authentication_token) %>).
</p>
<p>
  I chatted with a few writers and they liked the idea of making serialized stories official. I've taken it a step further than that: not only can you add segments to your own story, six minutes at a time, but you can also branch stories by other writers. To get started, below any story on the site, click "Add a Branch to this Story". <%= link_to "Here's a story by TonyNoland to try it out on", write_to_prompt_url(@branchable_story.prompt, parent_id: @branchable_story.id, user_email: @recipient.email, user_token: @recipient.authentication_token) %>. <%= link_to "And here's one about a missing elephant by yangjanice", write_to_prompt_url(@branchable_story_2.prompt, parent_id: @branchable_story_2.id, user_email: @recipient.email, user_token: @recipient.authentication_token) %>.
</p>
<p>
  I'm hoping this unlocks some potential epics and some potentially epic collaborations.
