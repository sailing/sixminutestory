It's been 10 years since I built Six Minute Story. A full on decade. I guess that means we're all older now.

In the past ten years, over 750 writers (like you) have written 655,000 words in more than 3500 stories.

Some of you have written oh-so-many stories. Anglea wrote 157.

Some other super-prolific writers of the last decade were:

  ganymeder - 117 stories
  Jayden Nicole - 98
  DoctorMikeReddy - 95
  the-arraignment - 84
  NYgirlLovesCA - 75
  bespectakate - 69
  Gone Awry - 66
  CraigTowsley - 65
  mroshaugh - 61

As for me, I've drifted in and out of other projects, sailed up and down the United States' east coast, built some stuff, worked in tech for a long time. But Six Minute Story has always been my first love. It's full of story, full of adrenaline, full of revelation. So, for the tenth anniversary, I think a revamp is in order.

Initially that just meant fixing the login form so you can actually log in and write. But then I thought why not make it even better.

A few years back some people started writing serialized stories (here's one from DoctorMikeReddy: https://sixminutestory.com/stories/3480-not-wanted-so-much-as-needed).

I chatted with a few writers and they liked the idea of making serialized stories official. I've taken it a step further than that: not only can you add segments to your own story, six minutes at a time, but you can also branch stories by other writers. To get started, just below any story on the site, click "Add a Branch to this Story". Here's a story to start with: https://sixminutestory.com/stories/2034-nurtured-into-a-mighty-oak#branch

I'm hoping this unlocks some potential epics and some potentially epic collaborations.
