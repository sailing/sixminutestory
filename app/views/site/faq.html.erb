<h4>
	What's the point?
</h4>
<div class="answer">	
	Conjuring a story in six minutes will hone your ability to think on your feet. It'll help you think flexibly and speak eloquently on demand. A quick wit is an asset as these days the ability to tell stories is vital to success.

<h4>
	I have an idea!
</h4>
<div class="answer">
	Great! We're all ears. You can get ahold of us via <a href="http://twitter.com/6minutestory">twitter</a>, or via <a href="http://facebook.com/sixminutestory">Facebook</a>, or via our <a href="http://sixminutestory.uservoice.com">feedback forum</a>.

<h4>
	Who owns the stories?
</h4><div class="answer">
	The stories are yours, but, this being the age of copyright and <a href="http://boingboing.net/copyfight/" target="_blank">copyfight</a>, we're simplifying things. Your stories must be licensed under your choice of <a href="http://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> and Public Domain licenses. The minimum license requires that you be attributed in any derivative or copied works. Other variations require that others also share (share alike), that your work be shared only non-commercially, and that your work is kept whole (no derivatives). We hope you'll agree that it's better to join the current towards a sharearchy, but if you don't like it, you can always write here and post your story to your own blog, copyright statement and all.

<h4>
	Do I have to submit my story?
</h4>
<div class="answer">
	Nope. Just click away without hitting submit.

<h4>
	Can I use this in my classroom?
</h4>
<div class="answer">
	Sounds good to us. We learned to write in high school and never looked back. If we can help empower another human, we're all for it. If there's enough demand we'll see about officially catering to classrooms, but in the meantime we suggest using tags to track your students' stories. For example, students in the Fall semester of English 101 at UW could tag their stories "UW-Eng101-Fall". Simple enough. If you have detailed questions, feel free to contact us.

<h4>
	I'm offended!
</h4>
<div class="answer">
	We don't censor ideas or words. Feel free to shield your eyes. We do delete "stories" that aren't stories and users who post them, as if anyone wanted your male enhancement formula anyway.
</div>

<h4>
	Will this make me famous?
</h4>
<div class="answer">
	We wish you success. If you do get famous, feel free to mention us.
</div>

<h4>
	And who are you?
</h4>
<div class="answer">
	"We" are <a href="http://profiles.google.com/withgalen">Galen</a>.
