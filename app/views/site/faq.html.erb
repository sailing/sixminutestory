<h4>
What's the point?
</h4>
<div class="answer">
Conjuring a story in six minutes will hone your ability to think on your feet. It'll help you think flexibly and speak eloquently on demand. A quick wit is an asset as the ability to tell stories is increasingly vital to institutional success.

<h4>
Can I write?
</div>
<div class="answer">
We assume you mean, "May I write?" The answer, either way, is yes. We only ask that you <%= link_to "sign up", register_url %> first, to limit trolls. As to your capability: writing stories is the same as telling a story out loud. You may even find it helpful to speak the story and type it as you go.</div>

<h4>
I'm offended!
</h4>
<div class="answer">
We don't censor ideas or words. Feel free to shield your eyes. We do delete "stories" that aren't stories and users who post them, as if anyone wanted your male enhancement formula anyway.

<h4>
Who owns the stories?
</h4><div class="answer">
The stories are yours, but, this being the age of copyright and <a href="http://boingboing.net/copyfight/" target="_blank">copyfight</a>, we're simplifying things. Your stories must be licensed under your choice of <a href="http://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> and Public Domain licenses. The minimum license requires that you be attributed in any derivative or copied works. Other variations require that others also share (share alike), that your work be used only non-commercially, and that your work is kept whole (no derivatives). We hope you'll agree that it's better to join the current towards a sharearchy, but if you don't like it, you can always write here and post your story to your own blog, copyright statement and all.

<h4>
Will this make me famous?
</h4>
<div class="answer">
We wish you success. <br />If you do get famous, feel free to mention us.
