A Year in Six Minutes
- State of the Six Minute Story

First off, I measure success in relationships, not numbers. So really, developing friendships and a community around Six Minute Story has been my reward.

But numbers are fun. 

So, here's Six Minute Story by the numbers, for 2010.

Stories
You are writing champs. All 606 of you. You wrote 933 stories to 168 different prompts in 2010. 

Even more impressive, the majority of those (886) were written after August 1st. That's over 175 stories a month for the last 5 months of 2010.

Those stories garnered 325 favorites and 618 comments.

Writers
Of the 606 of you, 552 joined in 2010 (497 after August 1). Over half of users are lurkers, with ~270 users writing all the stories.

I don't have a simple way yet to tell whose stories received the most favorites or the most views but I'm working on that for the future.

Speaking of the future of Six Minute Story.

Here's a few of the features I plan to add in 2011 (most are in progress): 
Random prompts.
Collections of stories (which you can create and curate – ie: "Best Sci-fi" or "Funniest stories").
A forum for conversations surrounding writing.
Emotions (when responding to a story, readers have the option to choose the emotion they felt).
Awards for top stories and top writers.
Contests.

As always, Six Minute Story is for you, so your input is considered. Suggestions and constructive criticism are always welcome.
